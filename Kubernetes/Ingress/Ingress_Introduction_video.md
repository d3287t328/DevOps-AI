## Introduction
Hello everyone, welcome to our tutorial on Kubernetes Ingress and Services. This video is designed for beginners, so we'll break down complex concepts into simpler terms.

## Setting the Context
Before we dive into Ingress, let's briefly touch on Kubernetes services. Services in Kubernetes are an abstract way to expose applications running as pods, which are the smallest deployable units of computing in Kubernetes.

## Kubernetes Services
Kubernetes services act as a proxy, identifying the required application or pod using labels and selectors. You can create services in three ways: 

- Cluster IP: An internal service within the Kubernetes cluster.
- Node Port: Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port.
- Load Balancer: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer.

## Ingress
Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

## Ingress Controllers
Ingress cannot work on its own. You need an Ingress controller, which is a daemon that interprets the Ingress rules and processes the data accordingly. There are many supported Ingress controllers, each with its own implementation.

## SSL/TLS with Ingress
Ingress also supports SSL/TLS for secure communication. There are three types: 

- SSL pass-through: SSL termination happens at the backend servers.
- SSL offloading (or SSL termination): SSL termination happens at the load balancer.
- SSL bridging: SSL termination happens at the load balancer, then re-encrypts the traffic to the backend servers.

## OpenShift Routes
If you're using OpenShift, you have the option to use OpenShift routes. The terminology is slightly different, but the concept is similar. OpenShift routes are objects that define rules for routing inbound traffic to backend services.

## Conclusion
That's a brief overview of Kubernetes Ingress and Services. Remember, the choice between different types of services, Ingress, and SSL/TLS types depends on your specific needs and security considerations.
