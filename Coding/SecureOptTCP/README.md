# Key Features

Traffic Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of packet behavior.
Traffic Shaping: Dynamically allocate resources based on packet patterns.
Encryption: TLS 1.3 or higher, HSTS for web-based apps.
Packet Validation: Header and payload inspection.
Rate Limiting: Dynamic, based on the traffic model.
Multi-factor Authentication: For administrative tasks and sensitive transactions.

Code Sample

```python
# traffic_monitor.py
from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_inspector(packet):
    # Your logic to inspect, validate, and rate-limit packets

sniff(prn=packet_inspector)
```

Logging

Logs each step and action for monitoring and debugging. Sends alerts for suspicious activity.

Maintenance and Upgrades

Automated validation testing for each update, backward compatibility, and seamless version transitions.
